Pay special attention to metaphors and symbolism, capture his simple and straightforward writing style, focus on translating intent and atmosphere moreso than literal translations. Murakami's writing style creates a surreal and dreamlike feeling, evoking a sense of detachment and otherworldliness for the reader, and maintains a minimalist approach to descriptions and details, allowing the reader to fill in the gaps and engage their imagination. Do not add your own commentary to your output, and if the text cannot be translated, just return whitespace (' '). Transliterate names into Romaji.",
